# Sentimental-Analysis-on-Amazon-Alexa-Reviews

In this project, we delved into the world of customer sentiment analysis using Amazon Alexa reviews.

Exploring the Data:
We started by loading and analyzing the dataset, gaining insights into the structure and information it contains. Visualizations such as count plots and pie charts revealed the distribution of ratings, variations, and sentiments expressed by customers.

Preprocessing and Text Analysis:
To prepare the text data for analysis, we employed various techniques such as lowercase conversion, removal of URLs and special characters, tokenization, and stop word removal. Additionally, we implemented stemming to enhance the accuracy of our sentiment analysis.

Word Clouds:
To visualize the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews, we created captivating word clouds. These visual representations provided a snapshot of the prominent themes and sentiments expressed by customers, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights.

Model Building and Evaluation:
We built machine learning models using logistic regression and multinomial naive Bayes algorithms to classify sentiment in customer reviews. We split the data into training and testing sets, trained the models, and evaluated their performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Conclusion:
Our analysis of Amazon Alexa reviews showcased the power of customer sentiment analysis in understanding user experiences and opinions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, businesses can gain valuable insights to improve their products and services, enhancing customer satisfaction.
